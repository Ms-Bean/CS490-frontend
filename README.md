# CS490-frontend
## A front end for the CS 490 project

This is the front-end for the CS 490 individual project.
The landing page is index.html. The front end basically uses onclick events to call functions in common.js, which goes absolutely bonkers with fetch calls to interact with the backend hosted locally on port 3500.

Features completed so far (in exact wording):
Landing Page:
- [x] As a user I want to view top 5 rented movies of all times.
- [x] As a user I want to be able to click on any of the top 5 movies and view its details
- [x] As a user I want to be able to view top 5 actors that are part of movies that I have in the store
- [x] As a user I want to be able to view the actorâ€™s details and view their top 5 rented movies
